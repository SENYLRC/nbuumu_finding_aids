    <head>Biographical Note</head>
<p>James Burrell Coover (born June 3, 1925 in Jacksonville, IL ; died May 28, 2004 in Williamsville, NY) earned his B.A. and M.A. in music theory at the University of North Colorado and an M.A. in library science from the University of Denver. Over the course of his library science degree, he also served as the Assistant Director of the Biographical Center for Research, Rocky Mountain Region in Denver.</p><p>After completing the library science degree in 1953, Coover became Director of the George Sherman Dickinson Music Library at Vassar College and taught courses in the music department, including music bibliography and jazz history. His strong interest in contemporary music led him to found Vassar's Faculty Study Group on Avant-Garde music in 1965. While at Vassar, he also became involved with the Hudson Valley Philharmonic as a performing percussionist from 1959 to 1967 and served as the personnel and special concerts manager of the organization.</p><p>He first became associated with the State University at Buffalo (SUNY) in 1967, where he served as a professor of music and the director of the Music Library until his retirement in 1999. While at Buffalo, he established a dual master's degree program in music librarianship with associate music librarian Carol June Bradley, taught the department's course in music bibliography, and developed an extensive research collection. He chaired the music department from the years 1974-1976 and 1978-1981; was named the Birge-Carey Professor from 1974-1976 and 1978-1981; held the Ziegele professorship from 1981-1999; was an adjunct professor in the School of Information and Library Science from 1980-1999; and was named a SUNY Distinguished Service Professor in 1992. Outside of UB, Coover was a consultant at several private and middle states institutions from 1957 to 1992. He was also actively involved in the Music Library Association, serving as President (1959-1960) and on the Board of Directors (1987-1990), the Publications Committee (1956-1958, 1966-1969, 1975-1978), and the Finance Committee (1967-1969, 1976-1980).</p><p>Coover is the author and editor of numerous writings, spanning over thirty published articles; various book and record reviews, essays, and pamphlets; and ten books. These cover topics related to music lexicography, music bibliography, music publishing and printing, antiquarian catalogues, discographies of jazz and medieval music, musical instrument collections, music theory, and collection development. These include Music Lexicography; Including a Study of Lacunae in Music Lexicography and a Bibliography of Music Dictionaries (1958); Music Instrument Collections (1981); Music Publishing, Copyright, and Piracy in Victorian England: A Twenty-Five Year Chronicle, 1881-1906 (1985); Antiquarian Catalogs of Musical Interest (1988); Music at Auction: Puttick and Simpson (1988); and Private Music Collections: Catalogs and Cognate Literature (2001).</p>  </bioghist>
